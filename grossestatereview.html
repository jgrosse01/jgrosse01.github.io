        State Goverment Website Review

            <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/">Vermont</a>
            <p>The Vermont government website is my #1 government website. The combination of the colors stormy blue and white are highly appealing to the eye. The fonts are simple and relaxing to look at. The menus and tabs to navigate the page are intuitive and allow easy navigation throughout the website. The images used and their free-flowing nature makes for an appealing collage of images. For these reasons, I think that the Vermont goverment website is the best of the five.</p>

            <a href="http://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee</a>
            <p>The Tennessee government website is my #2 government website. The combination of the colors red, white, and blue are appealing to the eye and bring America to mind which I feel is important for a government website. The fonts are simple and easy to read and evoke a sense of simple elegance. The menus are simple to navigate but lack descriptive sub-headings which makes navigating to the correct place a slight challenge. For these reasons, I think that the Tennessee state government website deserves the number two spot.</p>

        <li>
            <a href="http://www.alaksa.gov/">Alaksa</a>
            <p>The Alaksa government website is my #3 government website. The combination of the colors blue and yellow are appealing to the eye and the tan wrap background complements them well. The fonts and mismatch slightly and distract from the goal of the page, to inform. The menus are visually appealing and have great detail, but this detail on specific catagories leaves many catagories uncovered. The overall layout of the website, specifically the "Latest News" and "Alaska's Economy" could be more appealing and fit better if they were formatted differently or moved off of the main page. For these reasons, I think the Alaksa goverment website deserves the number 3 spot.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://www.ok.gov/">Oklahoma</a>
            <p>The Oklahoma government website is my #4 government website. The combination of the colors used are rather dull and boring, they lack accenting and appear to be moreso muted than is necessary. The fonts work well with the website and are easy to read. The menu, in the form of one link and a search box, leaves much to be desired as the user does not know what information they can find on the website, much less what to look for. The graphics used for accents and backgrounds work well for the website. For these reasons, I think the Oklahoma government website deserves 4th place.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://www.iowa.gov/"></a>
            <p>The Iowa government website is my #5 government website. The overwhelming amount of blue on the webpage is borderline distracting. The search box is well designed but the overall navigation of the page is extremely lacking and has a combinatino of overly detailed links and a search box which is not helpful to the user who browses the website without a specific purpose in mind. The fonts are visually appealing and easy to read. I think that the Iowa state government website feels too much like a search engine and not enough like a website. For these reasons, I think the Iowa government website deserves last place.</p>
