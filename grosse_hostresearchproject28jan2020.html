		<h1>Jake's Web Hosting Review</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Jake's Web Hosting Review, where I, Jake, will be reviewing three web hosts and giving my personal opinion on the best host of the three.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://www.bluehost.com" target="_new">BlueHost.com</a></h2>
			<p>BlueHost has web hosting plans starting at $7.99.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shared Wordpress Hosting: Ranges from $7.99/month to $14.99/month</li>
				<li>Shared Web Hosting: Ranges from $7.99/month to $23.99/month</li>
				<li>VPS Hosting: Ranges from $29.99/month to $119.99/month</li>
				<li>Dedicated Hosting: Ranges from $119.99/month to $209.99/month</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Shared Wordpress Hosting's basic plan allows for one website, a free SSL certification, 50GB of SSD storage, a year of free domain, 5 parked domains with 25 subdomains, and $200 of marketing credits. The plus plan for $10.99/month adds 30 days free of Office 365 Mailbox. The Choice Plus plan for $14.99/month adds a basic backup method from CodeGuard.</p>
			<p>Shared Web Hosting allows for one website with similar specifications to the Shared Wordpress Hosting basic plan. Moving to the Plus plan for $10.99/month allows for unlimited websites, unlimited SSD storage, unlimited domains, both parked and regular, spam experts, and a free 30 day Office 365 Mail service. Moving up again to $14.99/month, Domain Privacy + Protection and CodeGuard site backup are added. Moving up to pro adds a spam expert and a dedicated IP address.</p>
			<p>VPS hosting allows a host to host a private server with 2 cores, 30GB storage, 2GB RAM, 1TB bandwidth, and 1 IP address. Upgrading the plans add hardware resources to the user's server along with a single additional IP address.</p>
			<p>Dedicated Hosting is similar to VPS hosting but utilizes more resources. All levels utilize four cores, starting at 500GB storage, 4GB RAM, 5TB bandwidth, and 3 IP addresses, each additional level adds 500GB storage, doubles the RAM, adds 5TB bandwidth, and one IP address.</p>
			
			
			
		<h2><a href="http://www.fatcow.com" target="_new">FatCow.com</a></h2>
			<p>In addition to a fantastic pun, FatCow hosting has web hosting plans starting from $3.75/month.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Original FatCow Hosting: $12.95/month</li>
				<li>Wordpress Blog Hosting: $3.75/month</li>
				<li>VPS Service Hosting: $19.99/month</li>
				<li>Dedicated Server Hosting: $119.99/month</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Orginal FatCow Hosting starts at $12.95 for the annual plan. It includes unlimited disk space and bandwidth along with unlimited email addresses, FTP Users/SubUsers and customer support. It also comes with a free domain name, website builder, script tool and SSL-Server</p>
			<p>With pricing ranging from $3.75/month for the starter plan or $6.95/month for the essential plan, Wordpress Hosting on FatCow comes with a customized control panel and preinstalled themes and plugins. When upgrading to the essential plan, super speed, enhanced security and expert support are added.</p>
			<p>VPS Hosting starts at $19.99/month and allows for instantaneous deployment and variable resource plans allowing for guaranteed memory and high speed storage along with ease of use in a user friendly control panel.</p>
			<p>Dedicated Hosting is a similar service to VPS Hosting which allows for more hosting capacity in the form of server resources. It has higher operating speeds and its maximum performance is unaffected by other users.</p>
		
		
		
		<h2><a href="http://www.godaddy.com" target="_new">GoDaddy.com</a></h2>
			<p>GoDaddy has hosting services ranging from $5.99/month all the way to $89.99/month.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Web Hosting (Shared): $5.99/month</li>
				<li>Wordpress Hosting (Speed and ease of use): $6.99/month</li>

			</ul>
			<p>Shared Web Hosting guaranteed 99.9% uptime with industry-leading load times and 24/7/365 U.S.-based expert support. There are 4 levels of plan all of which increases either site capacity, storage space, or power.</p>
			<p>Wordpress Hosting allows for increased time for user as the websites are easy to configure. The websites also have automatic software updates and a pre-installed SSL.</p>
			<p>Business Web Hosting utilizes Virtual Private Server technology to rent server space with an easy to use GUI to allow common people to operate a server for their own motives.</p>
			<p>Reseller Hosting allows for building of a hosting business using rented servers from GoDaddy. Reseller Hosting includes unlimited websites and databases, unmetered bandwidth, and expert 24/7 customer service.</p>
			<p>VPS Hosting can be set up in minutes and utilizes GoDaddy's SSD servers hosted in regional datacenters. There are 4 plans each of which increases storage, ram, and dedicated CPU cores.</p>
			<p>Dedicated Hosting allows for full server root access and is best for resource intensive web applications. They come with 3 dedicated IP addresses, a one year SSL certificate, and unmetered bandwidth.</p>
			
			
			
		<h1>Personal Recommendation</h1>
			<p>My personal recommendation for choice of web hosting service would be GoDaddy.com as it is the cheapest webhost and has reliable uptime along with 24/7 customer support. They also offer the greatest number of services of the three web hosting providers. Each service option has a respectable number of features which are relevent to web design and ease of use for inexperienced users.</p>
