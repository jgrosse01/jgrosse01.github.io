                <h1>Summertime Dispositions</h1>

                <p>Summertime babies conform to a trend of having lower rates of depression throughout their lives and tend to hold optimistic outlooks toward life and the contained trepidations. In addition to their pattern of optimism and lower depression rates, women born during the summer months fit a general trend of having more developed grey-matter in the brain compared to those born in other seasons. This effect is reversed for men as the trend for men shows winter-born children are more intelligent than their counterparts born in other seasons.</p>

                <p>Though there are benefits to being born in summer, there are many drawbacks which have been observed. Summer children have been observed to struggle in school more so than children born in other seasons. This is likely due to the observed increase in vision problems, dyslexia, and trends toward mediocrity in summer born children.</p>
