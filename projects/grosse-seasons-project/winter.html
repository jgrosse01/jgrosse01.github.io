                <h1>Winter Constitutions</h1>

                <p>Those born in the winter tend to be solitude and self-sufficient. They often are attuned to the cold weather and spend their days looking out for others, protecting those who are close to them from the harmful tendencies of themselves or others.</p>

                <p>Winter babies are mild mannered, easygoing, and need time which they may spend with themselves or a very close counterpart. Those born in winter are far less likely to be irritable than those born in other seasons and have a seeming resistance to winter based seasonal disorders. This could be attributed to Camus's notion of the invincible summer which lays inside each winter-born child.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, those born in the winter become overwhelmed with the world and retreat to a safe space or a safe person for solace and warmth. Those who are close to winter-born persons and have earned the trust of said person have earned the fierce loyalty and vigorous affection of which those born in winter are capable of giving.</p>
