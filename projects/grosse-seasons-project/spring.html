                <h1>Springtime Natures</h1>

                <p>Those born in the springtime often live their lives drowning in optimism. Spring children have a tendency to remain incredibly positive outlook on all that inhabits in the world around them. Under circumstances which would ordinarily contribute to depression, anxiety, and an overall rough life, spring babies have a disposition which allows them to thrive through the melancholy and embrace the positivity of life.</p>

                <p>Spring babies often harbor great creativity awaiting its maiden voyage. This creativity can lead to great feats. Many spring babies manage to work their way into leadership roles and positions, finding they naturally take charge of situations and are often looked up to by their peers.</p>

                <p>Despite all of the positives that come with being born in the spring, many spring babies will develop heart problems and statistically speaking are significantly more likely to do as such than persons born in other seasons.</p>
