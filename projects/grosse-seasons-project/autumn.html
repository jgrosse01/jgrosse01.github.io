                <h1>Autumnal Temperments</h1>

                <p>Those born in autumn are ambitious and seek out adventure and fulfilment from their surroundings. Whether it be accomplishing and assignment in school or going on a mission trip to help children in a third world country, autumn born people are constantly seeking to improve themselves through the experience of aiding others. They are highly selfless and give what they can to those around them.</p>

                <p>Autumn children are resilient, much like those brought into the world during winter. They tend to psychologically resist all seasonal disorders and lower chances of depression and anxiety. Autumn babies are built to handle failure and learn from their mistakes to accomplish their goals and move on through constant improvement and recognition of, but not residence within, their shortcomings.</p>
