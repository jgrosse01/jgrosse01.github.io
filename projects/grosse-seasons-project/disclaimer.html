            <p style="text-indent:0;text-align:center;">Though these observed facts are based in studies and observations made by respected research institutions such as University of British Columbia, University of Connecticut, Columbia University and organizations within the governments of various nations such as the United States and Hungary, there is no concrete causation between season of birth and personality which is required within the science community to draw conclusions and affirm the verity of a concept. Therefore, the information provided on this website should be considered to be valid input, but should not be cited as fact in formal research or theses. These statements are made based on observations of general trends and are not necessarily specific to each person born in a given season.</p>
