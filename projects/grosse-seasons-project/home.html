                <h1>The Significance of Seasons</h1>

                <p>Seasons are simply in existence due to the Earth's rotation. Each unique season and all of their intricacies are explained through Earth's tilt and distance away from the star at the center of our solar system, Solis. Though this may be the case that the sun is closer to one's own side of the planet during summer and farther away during one's winter, there is much more significance to the concept of a season.</p>

                <p>Seasons represent and elicit smells, emotions, and memories from deep within the neurology of the human mind. Many of these underlying psychological affects stem from the environment of any given person, both in the sense of physical environment and social environment. Other people have variegated psychological affects on those surrounding them and many of the ways people interact with one another can be, if nothing else, correlated to seasonal shift.</p>

                <p>It has been observed by populations that people can generally be grouped by personality type or by certain characteristics based on which season or month they were born into. Though every person is truly unique in some way, general traits can be derived and expected from a quality as simple as a birthdate.</p>
